# Vector Multiplication/Division

Multiplying or dividing vectors should be explained on the same script as the previous one. The only difference is that we multiply the length of the resulting vector by a factor of 0.5. 

Basically, the values for x and y are simply multiplied by the value. In our example, this reduces the length by half.
Technically, this is implemented by appending a built-in function `mult()` to the vector to be multiplied. The parentheses indicate the value to be multiplied.

```JS
vectorLine. mult (0.5);
```

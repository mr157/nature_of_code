# Vector Normalizing

The vector normalization is nothing else than to create a unit vector with the length of 1, but the direction and vector remains the same. 
A normalized vector is created by dividing the vector by its own amount. The advantage is that the vector can now be scaled very well.

Technically, this is implemented by appending the built-in function `. normalize()` to the vector to be normalized.

```JS
vectorLine. normalize ();

```

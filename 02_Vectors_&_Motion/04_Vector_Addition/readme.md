# Vector Addition

In this script only one line in the code has changed: Line 14.

The built-in `. add()` function now adds the two vectors `position` and `velocity`. Basically, this is not different from what we used to do separately. The x and y values of the vectors are added together. The to be added vector is written in the bracket.

```js
   position. add (velocity);
```

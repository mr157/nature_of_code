# Liquid Experiment

In this section we will work out step by step how to run the mover objects in different environments. We will divide the canvas into areas, which all have different flow characteristics. These environments present liquids that have to pass through the movers and thus have an impact on the movement of the movers.
The basic structure is explained in 4 steps, the basic prerequisite is created (identification of liquids) and the effect of a liquid is demonstrated. In the last part several liquids are implemented.
